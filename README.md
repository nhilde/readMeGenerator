# readMeGenerator


## Description

This project was made to help generate quick README files with user input to spend more time on coding rather than writing out READMEs. <br>
It was a great experiance to work with node and inquirer and seeing how they work. 

## Installation

The application can be accessed through the GitHub repository.

## Usage

Open index.js in the integrated terminal and type "node index.js" and hit enter. A series of prompts will appear and after answering each prompt, <br> a README.md file will
be generated in the demoREADME folder. A link to a video demonstrating the application in use is below. <br>
